# Movie-Recommender
This Java program utilizes the Pearson Correlation and Collaborative Filtering algorithms to make movie recomendations to users from public datasets uploaded by GroupLens. 

The program reads in datasets of movies and their user ratings, stores user and movie data in a series of HashMaps, and then allows the program user to either enter a user ID and movie to get a user's predicted preference for a movie OR enter a user ID and number to get a list of the top movies for that user. 

The Three Tier Architecture, Abstract Factory, and Concrete Factory design patterns were drawn upon in this program.

To run this program, download all of the .java files, save them in the same directory, and run Presentation.java. Additionally, the movies.dat and ratings.dat datasets will need to be downloaded and saved in the same directory, which can be found [here](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) under the 'MovieLens 10M Dataset'.

This program was written by Conner Evans and Connor Fairman.
